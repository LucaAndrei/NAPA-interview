# NAPA Interview project
Spring Boot + REST API + MySQL + AngularJS + Leaflet

This project was required at a technical interview for NAPA Ltd.
Being in the maritime industry, the scope of the project was to show & filter the ships on a map.
Some of the technologies used are now outdated.

I ended up getting the job :)
